        <p>Hello everyone. This will show the website when I'm done creating it.</p>
		<a href="/find-book">Find a book!</a>
		
		<br><br><br>

		<p><strong>EIGHTH GRADERS!</strong><br>
			Do not add books we read last year. There is no point.
			Everyone looking at this website either has read them
			or will read them by the end of the year. <i>The Giver</i> is
			okay, though, since we didn't read that, even though
			seventh grade is reading it.<br><br>
		
			<strong>EVERYONE!</strong><br>
			Do not add sequels. If you want to add a book that's in
			a series, add the first book and note that it's in a
			series.
		</p>

		<p><strong>Note:</strong> genres, page count, and series have been temporarily disabled on the grounds that
			they provide too much information about the book. I've been thinking about the wrapped
			books and they had only a description on them. I've kept the in the classroom, though,
			just as helpful information that doesn't in any way provide too much information. I'll
			leave a poll, though, so you can vote on which to add back.
		</p>

		<p>I'll ask you, though, please do not cheat.</p>
