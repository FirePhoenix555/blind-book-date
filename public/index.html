			<p><strong>EIGHTH GRADERS!</strong><br>
				Do not add books we read last year. There is no point.
				Everyone looking at this website either has read them
				or will read them by the end of the year. <i>The Giver</i> is
				okay, though, since we didn't read that, even though
				seventh grade is reading it.<br><br>
			
				<strong>EVERYONE!</strong><br>
				Do not add sequels. If you want to add a book that's in
				a series, add the first book and note that it's in a
				series.
			</p>

		</div>

		<div id="side-container" class="container">

			<p><strong>Note:</strong> genres, page count, and series have been temporarily disabled on
				the grounds that they provide too much information about the book. I've been thinking 
				about the wrapped books and they had only a description on them. I've kept the in the 
				classroom just as helpful information to avoid cases of "I don't want to have to buy a
				book." I'll leave a poll, so you can vote on which to add back.
			</p>

			<p>I'll ask you, though, please do not cheat.</p>
