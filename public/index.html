        <p>Hello everyone. This will show the website when I'm done creating it.</p>
		<a href="/find-book">Find a book!</a>
		
		<br><br><br>

		<p>Note: genres, page count, and series have been temporarily disabled on the grounds that
			they provide too much information about the book. I've been thinking about the wrapped
			books and they had only a description on them. I've kept the in the classroom, though,
			just as helpful information that doesn't in any way provide too much information. I'll
			leave a poll, though, so you can vote on which to add back.
		</p>

		<p>I'll ask you, though, please do not cheat.</p>
